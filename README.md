# CSVtoSQL-WFA
A small sub-project I used a long time ago to read and transform CSV data into objects and insert them on a SQL database. It was built using Visual Studio Community as a (C#) Windows Forms Application for desktop.

This project might not be working and should be moved to a .NET Core solution soon, which will (hopefully) be found as one of my GitHub repos.

If you want to try to use it as it is, you should try to build it using Visual Studio. You will also need a SQL database according to the model used in this project.
